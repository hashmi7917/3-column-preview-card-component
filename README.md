## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned How To Make Layouts, How to structure fronted elements

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card sedans">
  <img src="./images/icon-sedans.svg" alt="sedans" />
  <h1>Sedans</h1>
  <p class="para">
    Choose a sedan for its affordability and excellent fuel economy. Ideal for
    cruising in the city or on your next road trip.
  </p>
  <button class="btn">Learn More</button>
</div>
```

```css
.card {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 325px;
  min-height: 445px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 45px;
}
```

### Continued development

CSS Flexbox and CSS Grids
